# Models Directory

This directory contains models that can be used in your simulation environment. Models are organized into subdirectories based on their type and purpose.

## Subdirectories

### descriptions
This folder contains detailed descriptions of various models including robots, sensors, and hybrids. Each description file provides the specifications and configurations for the respective model.

- **robots**: Specifications and configurations of robotic models.
- **sensors**: Specifications and configurations of senor models.
<!-- - **hybrids**: Specifications and configurations of hybrid models (combinations of robots and sensors). -->

### objects_scenes
This folder contains SDF (Simulation Description Format) files used to define objects and scenes for simulations.
- **sdf files**: SDF files that define the world, objects, and environments used in simulations.

<!-- ### project
This folder contains SDF files used to define scenes for the Robotics II project. -->

<!-- ## Usage
- To add a new model, create a new file in the appropriate subdirectory.
- Update existing models by modifying their respective files.
- Use SDF files in the `objects_scenes` folder to define new simulation environments. -->
