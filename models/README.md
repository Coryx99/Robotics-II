# Models Directory

This directory contains all the models used in our Drake simulations. Models are organized into subdirectories based on their type and purpose.

## Subdirectories

### descriptions
This folder contains detailed descriptions of various models including robots, sensors, and hybrids. Each description provides the specifications and configurations for the respective model.

- **robots**: Specifications and configurations of robotic models.
- **sensors**: Specifications and configurations of sensor models.
- **hybrids**: Specifications and configurations of hybrid models (combinations of robots and sensors).

### objects&scenes
This folder contains SDF (Simulation Description Format) files used to define objects and scenes for simulations.

- **sdf files**: SDF files that define the world, objects, and environments used in simulations.

### old
This folder contains deprecated or old models that are no longer in active use but kept for reference purposes.

## Usage

- To add a new model, create a new file in the appropriate subdirectory.
- Update existing models by modifying their respective files.
- Use SDF files in the `objects&scenes` folder to define new simulation environments.
